# Kaage-Pi

Why I Built It
I wanted to see if a usable Linux single-board computer could be built in India for under ₹2,000, using nothing more than open components, community knowledge, and hand-soldering tools.

Most of the SBCs we use today — Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc. — are amazing. I wanted to prove that we can build our own — from the ground up — using parts available locally, and learn how Linux truly runs on bare metal in the process.

That’s how Kaage Pi was born: a home-soldered board built around the Allwinner V3s, an ARM Cortex-A7 SoC with 64 MB of integrated DDR2 RAM — powerful enough to boot Linux without any external memory.

This project isn’t about competing with Raspberry Pi. It’s about understanding, experimenting, and inspiring others to start their own journey in open hardware — where you can hold a running Linux system that you built with your own hands.

If you’ve ever wondered “Can I really make my own Linux board?” — the answer is yes, you can. Start small, stay patient, and let curiosity lead.
